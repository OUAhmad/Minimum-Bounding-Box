# Minimum-Bounding-Box
The goal is to find a minimum area convex hull in higher dimensions. The work here is done under the jurisdiction of Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan

### Minimum Volume Bounding Box for 3D set of points

Given a 3D set of points in 3D, we intend to find the minimum area bounding box that can contain the convex hull ergo can contain all the points in space.

#### Example:
